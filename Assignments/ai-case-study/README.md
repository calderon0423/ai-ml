#Anthropic - An AI Safety and Research Company
##Overview and Origin

Anthropic is an AI safety and research startup based in San Francisco. It was founded in 2021 by siblings Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei. The Amodeis are former members of OpenAI, the company responsible for ChatGPT. The Amodeis left OpenAI due to directional differences as they believed that advanced AI should value safety first and foremost. The Amodeis feared that an investment from Microsoft would push OpenAI onto an overly commercial path, jeopardizing safety. 

Although a fairly young company, Anthropic is already disrupting the AI space with its innovative, forward-thinking solutions. “Anthropic's goal is to create a future where AI benefits humans – not one where humans are beholden to its whims *(Cerebral Valley : A Brief History of Anthropic (Claude))*." 

##Funding

Anthropic has raised a total of $7.6B over 9 rounds of funding. The first round was in May 2021 and raised an impressive $124 million. The latest round completed in October 2023. Today, there are a total of 45 investors. 

A contentious early investor is Alameda Research, the hedge fund of now disgraced FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. In 2021, Alameda invested $500 million. “The valuation of the Anthropic stake may hover around 1 billion as Anthropic’s valuation has tripled to $15 billion *(Coin Desk: FTX Estate Can Sell Near 8% Stake in AI StartUp Anthropic, Court Rules (Singh))*." Anthropic’s rapid evaluation growth led FTX to file a motion in early February 2024 to sell around 7.84% of its stake. The motion was approved later that month. 

Two other large investors are Amazon and Google. In September 2023, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment. As part of the deal, Anthropic would use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider and planned to make its AI models available to AWS customers. A month later, Google announced a $2 billion investment over time, adding to its $550 million funding from earlier that year. Google’s investment should come as no surprise. Part of Google's mission statement is to "organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful" *(Cerebral Valley : A Brief History of Anthropic (Claude))*.

##Business Activities

“Anthropic is dedicated to building systems that people can rely on and generating research about the opportunities and risks of AI" *Company \ Anthropic. www.anthropic.com/company*.
On their website, Anthropic states that their goal is to address the unpredictability, unreliability, and opaqueness of current AI systems. 

Anthropic has two distinct end users. With its frontier AI research, Anthropic aims to communicate any learnings from their work to help promote safe and reliable AI and help guide policies in this space. The research  customers are policymakers and the society as a whole. However, Anthropic’s research is not purely academic. The research is translated into tangible, practical tools like Claude, a next generation AI assistant. The end users for this product are businesses, nonprofits and society as a whole.  Anthropic claims to have “thousands” of customers. Among its select business partners are Quora, Notion, Zoom, DuckDuckGo, and SK Telecom. The services range from enhanced search to interactive consumer solutions to code assistance. 

Anthropic’s main product, Claude, is a direct competitor to ChatGPT. It was first released in March 2023 powered by the language model Claude 1.3. A second version of Claude powered by the Claude 2 language model was released a few months later in July 2023. Anthropic has also released another, nimbler, lighter model that gives quicker responses, called Claude Instant. 

This month, Claude 4 was released and has surged ahead of competitors like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. According to Anthropic, “Claude 3 has not only surpassed its predecessors but has also achieved “near-human” proficiency in various tasks. The company attributes this success to rigorous testing and development, culminating in three distinct chatbot variants: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus (Daws).” Sonnet is available for free while Opus is available via a subscription-based service, Claude Pro. Opus seamlessly integrates text and images. 

Claude 3, Anthropic’s newest and best LLM, is trained on over 100 trillion text and code parameters, far surpassing any other AI system. <“With so many more parameters to capture intricacies in language and reasoning, Claude 3 begins exhibiting common sense, robustness to confusion, and adaptive conversation like never before possible. The jump from 10 billion to 100 trillion unlocks paradigm-shifting potential"(Ai).<

What sets Claude apart from competitors is its ability to consistently produce safe responses. This is due to it being trained with Constitutional AI. Constitutional AI uses AI feedback to evaluate outputs. The system uses a set of principles to make judgments about outputs, hence the term Constitutional. This constitution guides the model to help avoid discriminatory outputs and illegal or unethical activities. Constitutional AI delivers an honest AI system that is helpful and harmless. 

Anthropic is able to prioritize safety thanks to its class. Anthropic is one of four US-incorporated AI startups to be “classed as a public-benefit company – a corporation that is set up to make a profit, but is doing so by working on something that will have a positive impact on humanity" *(Drapkin and Drapkin)*.

Another key differentiator for Claude is its context window which is over an order of magnitude greater than that of GPT-4’s. At 200K tokens (roughly 150K words). In particular, its extremely large context window allows it to parse longer prompts that may be commonplace in certain industries such as Law.

##Landscape
Anthropic is an Artificial Intelligence research company in the generative AI market. 

Artificial Intelligence has gone through a revolution in the past few years due to the maturing of machine learning, availability of cloud-computing resources and wide-spread data gathering. These three factors have driven hot AI research trends like deep learning, computer vision and Natural Language Processing just to name a few. 

Deep learning, “a branch of artificial intelligence inspired by the structure of the human brain, has made enormous strides in giving machines the ability to intuit the physical world" *(Singh)*. Deep learning-based systems make sense of data for themselves, without the need of an explicit algorithm. It allows the machines to learn from their experience. Some are now about as good at object and speech recognition as people. Applications for deep learning include object recognition, video labeling and activity recognition. 

Advancements in deep learning and large-scale computing have led to the next hot trend in AI, computer vision. <“Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning and neural networks to teach computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs—and to make recommendations or take actions when they see defects or issues"> *(What Is Computer Vision? | IBM)*. Computer vision is used in a wide range of industries such as energy, manufacturing and automotive. The market is expected to continue to grow and surpass $50 billion by 2030. 

Lastly, Natural Language Processing is another hot trend in AI. It is enabled by the ability to gather wide-spread, web-based data. Research is now shifting towards developing capable and refined ystems that are able to interact with people through dialog, not just react to stylized requests

Other major companies in the generative AI space are OpenAI’s Chat GPT, Google’s Gemini, Meta’s Lamma 2 and Amazon’s Codewhisperer. Another notable competitor is Cohere, a leading NLP model provider founded by former Google Brain AI researcher and Hugging Face.Hugging Face is known as  the “GitHub for machine learning”. According to a Bloomberg Intelligence report, the generative AI market is poised to expand, growing to $1.3 trillion by 2032. 

Anthropic also competes with various established AI research labs backed by tech giants; most notably, Google’s DeepMind, Meta AI, and Microsoft Azure AI.

##Results
Anthropic is listed as the third fastest growing tech company by TrueUp and is projected to generate more than $850 million in annualized revenue by the end of this year. This is a significant increase from $10 million in 2022. However, revenue falls short compared to ChatGPT’s $1.6 billion in 2023. 

Some of the core metrics used in this field to measure financial success are subscriptions and enterprise usage and/or adoption. 

Anthropic makes money in a few ways: via usage of its chatbot Claude, and via its AI models. Anthropic charges users on a usage-based pricing model. Every million tokens (approximately 750K words) processed by Claude 2 costs $11.02 for prompts and $32.68 for completions. This is based on a context window of 100,000 tokens. For reference, OpenAI charges $60/million prompt tokens and $120/million completion tokens for GPT-4 with a 32,000 token window.

However, wide scale monetization remains a challenge for generative AI companies.

Measuring the accuracy of the language model is another key success metric. It is done via a series of benchmark cognitive tests. According to Tech.co “Claude is more articulate than ChatGPT, and its answers are usually better written and easier to read" *(Drapkin and Drapkin)*.

##Recommendations
Based on Claude’s unique Constitutional AI approach, I would recommend they continue to expand and dominate the enterprise space. “A survey in June 2023 reported that only 29% of business leaders had faith in the ethical use of commercial AI at the present moment, though 52% were “very confident” in ethical use within five years" *(“Report: Anthropic Business Breakdown and Founding Story”)*. Anthropic has a competitive advantage in gaining the trust of corporate leaders as Claude has proven its ability to consistently produce safe responses. 

Additionally, Claude 2.1 boasts the industry leading context window with 200,000 tokens which is twice as long as that of GPT-4 Turbo. This allows Claude to analyze large documents of up to 150,000 words or 500 pages. With this competitive advantage, Claude is uniquely positioned to synthesize large documents and research in the corporate world. 

Offering large document and esearch processing would allow Anthropic to establish itself as the holistic AI enterprise solution of the future. From here, Anthropic could expand into other enterprise solutions such as fraud detection, customer insight synthesis, demand forecasting and advertisement just to name a few. 

In order to offer these solutions, Anthropic needs to continue to invest in deep learning to ensure its LLM, Claude, is competitive and one of the industry leaders. Additionally, Anthropic must stay true to its goal to create a future where AI benefits humans – not one where humans are beholden to its whims as this is a critical differentiator.
